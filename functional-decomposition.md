# Functional decomposition 
## Getting food from a vending machine 

You sell a bag of chips to buyer
- Wait for buyer to approach you 
- Wait for buyer to determine the flavor 
- Wait for buyer to key in code for flavor 
    - Process their code and find equivalent chips
- Display equivalent amount of money of their desired chips
- Wait for buyer to drop coins in 
    - If they insert more money more than required drop their change 
    - Wait for them to collect their change 
    - If not move on 
- Dispense their desired bag of chips 
    - Wait for them to grab the chips through the slot 
   

## Wake up and go to school 
- Use input to determine day of the week
- Use variables to store day of week 
- Use conditional statements to determine wake up time and get ready activities (whether to wear uniform or not) 
- Create different sets of commands depending on the day of the week (which extracurricular activities) 
- Use loop until condition is met (keep doing homework until it is done) 
- Use conditional statements to determine activity (if there are no assignments have a snack) 

## The cookie is too big for the glass 
1. Break the cookie in half or break off a piece from the widest part of the cookie
- Loop until widest part of cookie is still less than radius of glass 
2. Make sure widest part of cookie is less than radius of glass
- Measure widest part of cookie and buy a glass with a greater radius 
- Measure radius of glass and buy smaller cookies 
3. Tells user size of glass or size of cookie they need to buy based on their input 
- User will input either the size of the cookie or radius of the glass
- App will then generate a range of sizes for the cookie or radius of glass they need to buy
- If user has measurements of both app will tell if cookie will be able to fit
